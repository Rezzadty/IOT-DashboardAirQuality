# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Project Overview

This website is focused on building an IoT dashboard for monitoring and displaying real-time data retrieved from Firebase Realtime Database using API integration. The main purpose of this project is to visualize air quality data in an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

### Key Features
- Real-time data synchronization with Firebase Realtime Database
- Interactive dashboard for air quality monitoring
- Responsive design for various devices
- Data visualization for IoT sensor readings

### Important Notes
Please note that this website is currently under active development as part of my bachelor's final project. The primary focus at this stage is on implementing the data display functionality and ensuring reliable data fetching from Firebase. The codebase may still require optimization and refactoring as the project progresses.

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: React with Vite
- **Database**: Firebase Realtime Database
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: CSS (customizable)

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
